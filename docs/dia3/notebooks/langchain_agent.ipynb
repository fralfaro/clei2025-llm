      "   - Relevant Scientific Documentation Insight:\n",
      "     - Architectural feature extraction typically involves representing architecture characteristics as informative features (e.g., one-hot encoding for tactics, graph embeddings for structure).\n",
      "     - These encoded features allow for downstream machine learning and optimization tasks.\n",
      "   - Improvement Suggestions:\n",
      "     - Add a clear explanation in overview.md describing how JSON fields are mapped/encoded into model features (including any one-hot or embedding scheme used).\n",
      "     - Illustrate with an example: show a snippet of an input JSON and how it becomes a feature vector for the surrogate.\n",
      "     - Consider linking to background materials on graph embeddings and feature engineering for architectures.\n",

      "   - Issue Summary: The documentation does not detail how the surrogate model's training data is generated or normalized; should be covered in docs/model_training.md.\n",
      "   - Relevant Scientific Documentation Insight:\n",
      "     - Surrogate model training requires a dataset of architecture configurations and quality attribute values, generated by sampling or heuristics.\n",
      "     - Data is often normalized to ensure effective model convergence.\n",
      "     - The model is retrained as more data becomes available.\n",
      "   - Improvement Suggestions:\n",
      "     - Add a section explaining how architectural design points are sampled/generated for training.\n",
      "     - Describe any normalization or preprocessing applied to both features and target values.\n",
